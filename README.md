# malloc-viz
Project built to soldify my understanding of memory management techniques/theory that is discussed
in the book "Operating Systems in Three Easy Pieces".

## Features
* mmaped block of memory that is treated like a heap
* Custom malloc/dealloc methods to interacy with this block of memory
* Option to choose from various memory allocation techniques like first-fit, worst-fit, best-fit and buddy allocation.
* Option to visualize the heap in the terminal.
